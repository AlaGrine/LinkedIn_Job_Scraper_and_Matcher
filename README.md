## Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>

If you're looking for a job, say a data science role, you're probably using Linkedin Jobs.
But with hundreds of jobs posted every day, it can be hard to find the ones that best match your skills.

The main purpose of this project is to help you find the best matching jobs automatically.

In this project we:

1. Built a Linkedin job scraper using `Selenium`, `Requests` and `BeautifulSoup`.
2. Built a text analysis of your resume and LinkedIn jobs using `Spacy`.
3. Developed a `Flask` app to display data visualisations, including a word cloud of in-demand skills. The app highlights job-specific skills and keywords, compares them to your skills and generates a list of the most relevant job matches.

## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

This project requires Python 3 and the following Python libraries installed:

1. WEB scraping libraries: `Selenium`, `Requests`, `BeautifulSoup`
2. NLP libraries: `Spacy`, `NLTK`
3. Web app and visualization: `Flask`, `Plotly`, `Matplotlib`, `Wordcloud`
4. Other libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `json`

5. Install the trained English pipeline from Spacy.io as follows:
   `python -m spacy download en_core_web_lg `

The full list of requirements can be found in the `requirements.txt` file.
